# basicbots
just simple logic using Dreambot API to handle some tedious tasks for a game called Old School RuneScape 
When I have more time I was planning on implementing more complex bots, a new design framework and organizing my packages using MVC style.

More information about documentation Scripts API + Setup process can all be found here: https://dreambot.org/
